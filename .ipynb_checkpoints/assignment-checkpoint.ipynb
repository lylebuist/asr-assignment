    "You are provided with two Python modules `observation_model.py` and `wer.py`.  The first was described in [Lab 3](https://github.com/yiwang454/asr_labs/blob/main/asr_lab3_4.ipynb).  The second can be used to compute the number of substitution, deletion and insertion errors between ASR output and a reference text.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "wer.compute_alignment_errors(my_reference, my_output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces a tuple $(s,d,i)$ giving counts of substitution,\n",
    "deletion and insertion errors respectively - in this example (1, 0, 1).  The function accepts either two strings, as in the example above, or two lists.  Matching is case sensitive.\n",

    "Assuming that you have already made a function to generate an WFST, `create_wfst()` and a decoder class, `MyViterbiDecoder`, you can perform recognition on all the audio files as follows:\n"
